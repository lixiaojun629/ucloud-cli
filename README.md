## Example

Taking create uhost in Nigeria (region: air-nigeria) and bind a public IP as an example, then configure GlobalSSH to accelerate the SSH efficiency beyond China mainland.

First to create an uhost instance:

```
$ ucloud uhost create --cpu 1 --memory 1 --password **** --image-id uimage-fya3qr

UHost:[uhost-tr1e] created successfully!
```

*Note* 

Run follow command to get details regarding the parameters to create new uhost instance.

```
$ ucloud uhost create --help
```

And suggest run the command to get the image-id first.

```
$ ucloud image list
```

Secondly, we're going to allocate an EIP and bind to the instance created above.

```
$ ucloud eip allocate --line International --bandwidth 1
allocate EIP[eip-xxx] IP:106.75.xx.xx  Line:BGP

$ ucloud eip bind --eip-id eip-xxx --resource-id uhost-xxx
bind EIP[eip-xxx] with uhost[uhost-xxx]
```

Configure the GlobalSSH to the uhost instance and login the instance via GlobalSSH

```
$ ucloud gssh create --location Washington --target-ip 152.32.140.92
gssh[uga-0psxxx] created

$ ssh root@152.32.140.92.ipssh.net
root@152.32.140.92.ipssh.net's password: password of the uhost instance
```
